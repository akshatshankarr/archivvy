        <p class="about-p1">
            ever felt like the algorithm REALLY gets you? i mean every song just straight banger after banger? <br>
            but who's gonna go back and add everything to a playlist right that's so tedious
        </p>
        <p class="about-p2">
            Archivvy was built to give you an easy way to archive your listening history into 
            playlists without having to click on every single track <br>
            this has been incredibly useful for me on occasion and i hope it serves you similarly
        </p>
