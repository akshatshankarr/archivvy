Building a spotify api wrapper compiled into a minimal, clean webapp to provide users with easy access to functions which would otherwise be locked behind an iterative based control.

Current features:
    - Archive your last 50 played tracks
    - Added functionality to remove certain tracks via the get-tracks endpoint

Coming Soon:
    - Playlist imports/exports to and from various other music platforms
